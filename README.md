Startup Guide for Express.js Routes
This guide outlines how to start and run the API server defined in the provided code.

1. Setting Up the Environment:

Ensure Necessary Dependencies:
Install dotenv, cors, and express using npm install dotenv cors express.
Ensure any additional dependencies mentioned in the code (./models/dbConnect) are installed.
Configure Environment Variables:
Create a .env file in the project root and add any environment variables used by the code, like database connection details.
Use require('dotenv').config(); to load the .env file contents.
Database Connection (Optional):
If your .models/dbConnect file handles database connection, ensure the database is running and the connection details are correct.

2. Running the Server:

Start the API Server:
Run the script containing the code provided. This is typically node app.js where app.js is your main script.
Verify Server Running:
The server should print a message like "Server running on 8000" in the terminal.
Test the Routes:
Use tools like Postman or Insomnia to send requests to the defined routes:
Get all questions: GET http://localhost:8000/api/questions
Create a question: POST http://localhost:8000/api/questions (with appropriate payload)
Get all responses: GET http://localhost:8000/api/questions/answer
Get responses to a specific question: GET http://localhost:8000/api/questions/answer/<questionID>
Answer a specific question: POST http://localhost:8000/api/questions/answer/<questionID> (with answer data)

3. Additional Notes:

This guide covers basic startup steps. Refer to the code comments and individual route implementations for specific details.
The provided code uses a router for /api/questions routes. You can further organize your routes into separate routers based on functionality.
Remember to handle errors and implement appropriate security measures for your production environment.
